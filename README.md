# CalSAFE
The CalSAFE application was built as one of the California Digital Services Innovation Academyâ€™s final projects. It is intended to augment existing emergency notification systems in California with additional functionality. This includes a home page with emergency event information, the ability to create an account with user specific information, an iframe map of specific event resources/information, an iframe application to crowdsource photos and/or video of the event from the public, and a check-in system to notify that an individual has removed themselves from danger and that they are in a secure location.
